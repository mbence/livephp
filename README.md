livephp
=======

LivePHP will save developers time by automatically refreshing the browser when any file is changed in the working directory.

== Description ==

This little script was written to make developers' life easier.
Inspired by the brilliant live.js script (written by Martin Kool),
this script will auto refresh your browser if you change any file in your working directory. No need for Alt-Tab and manual refresh anymore.

New feature with v1.2: Css files are now refreshed without reloading the whole page.

With this script, it is also very easy to check your work in many browsers simultaneously.
Just load the site in all your browsers or devices and the rest goes automatically.

WARNING!
You should never activate this on a live server! It is meant for developer environment only!

== Installation ==

Copy the included files in your directory and include the livephp.js script in your html. Opitonally you can set the directories to monitor or ignore in the livephp-monitor.php file
