<p><em>LivePHP will save PHP developers time by automatically refreshing the browser when any files are changed the working directory.</em></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This little script was written to make  developers' life easier.<br>
  Inspired by the brilliant live.js script (written by Martin Kool), <br>
this script will auto refresh your browser if you change any files in your working directory. No need for Alt-Tab and manual refresh anymore.</p>
<p>With this script, it is also very easy to check your work in many browsers simultaneously. <br>
  Just load the site in all your browsers or devices and the rest goes automatically.</p>
<p>WARNING!<br>
You should never activate this  on a live server! It is meant for developer environment only!</p>
<h2> Installation</h2>
<p>Copy the included files in your directory and include the livephp.js script in your html. Opitonally you can set the directories to monitor or ignore in the livephp-monitor.php file.<br>
